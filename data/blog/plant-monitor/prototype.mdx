## Intro

In the previous part of this blog series I explained how the ESP board can securely connect and transmit data to Firebase RTDB. However, currently the sensor, the board and the shield are just loosely hanging around
on their wires, which is less than ideal when I have to actually put this into a real plant or garden

## Connection OLED screen and displaying data to it

In the past chapters I mentioned an OLED display as an optional requirement.
Right now all of the data is already present in RTDB and can be fetched and distributed by any application I choose, therefore an external display is not needed at all. Moreover, it will significantly shorten the
battery life. However, I want to connect an external display just for the fun of it... and the things I'll learn of course.

The display that I'll be using in 0.96" 128x64 inexpensive I2C OLED [101864](https://www.smart-prototyping.com/0-96-OLED-Display-IIC-New-Version). It has only 4 pins and this is the connection scheme.
(I already have the moisture sensor connected to the ground (G) pin, so I had to solder a common wire between them.)

Next, you need to add the Adafruit libraries to Arduino IDE in order to control the OLED. Open Arduino IDE and click Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries. Search for Adafruit, and scroll down to the Adafruit Gfx library and install it. Next, scroll down to the Adafruit SSD1306 library and install it.

Here's a tiny code snippet that you can use to test the display and the connection. Alternatively, you can use one of the examples that come with the SSD1306 library.

```c
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>
#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>

#define SCREEN_WIDTH 128
#define SCREEN_HEIGHT 64

Adafruit_SSD1306 display(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, &Wire, -1);

void setup()   {
  if (!display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C)) {
    Serial.println(F("SSD1306 allocation failed"));
    for (;;);
  }
  delay(2000);
  display.setTextSize(1);
  display.setTextColor(WHITE);
  display.setCursor(0, 10);
  display.println("Hello world");
  display.display();
}

void loop() {
}
```

After upload, you should see the text "Hello world" on the screen.

## Integrating the display to the existing Sketch

I would like the display to print all the information on it during the connection and the interaction with RTDB (like a linux terminal). For this I'll define a new method
that will take input parameters and will print them both on the display and to the serial monitor. This way I debug issue with connection and sensor easily while only looking at the OLED screen
or by inspecting the serial when the device is connected via USB.

```c
// Initializes the OLED screen on startup
void initializeOledAndShowStartupScreen() {
  if (!display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C)) {
    Serial.println(F("SSD1306 allocation failed"));
    for (;;);
  }
  delay(2000);
  display.setTextSize(1);
  display.setTextColor(WHITE);
  display.setCursor(0, 10);
  logMessage("Waking up!");
  delay(2000);
}
```

```c
// Appends a (formatted) message to the display and to serial output
// Formats the display output in 3 lines of 2 rows. When the buffer is full, clears the bottom most line and puts a new one on top (like a stack)
// Also accepts variable arguments
void logMessage(const char* format, ...) {
  va_list args;
  va_start(args, format);

  // Get current time
  timeClient.update();
  hours = timeClient.getHours() + 2; // convert to my time zone
  minutes = timeClient.getMinutes();
  seconds = timeClient.getSeconds();

  char buffer[128];
  vsnprintf(buffer, sizeof(buffer), format, args);

  // Format hours and minutes with leading zeros
  String formattedHours = (hours < 10) ? "0" + String(hours) : String(hours);
  String formattedMinutes = (minutes < 10) ? "0" + String(minutes) : String(minutes);

  String logMessage = formattedHours + ":" + formattedMinutes + "> " + String(buffer);
  currentLine = (currentLine + 1) % MAX_LINES;
  logLines[currentLine] = logMessage;

  display.clearDisplay();

  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_LINES; i++) {
    int lineIndex = (currentLine - i + MAX_LINES) % MAX_LINES;
    display.setCursor(0, i * 16);
    display.println(logLines[lineIndex]);
  }

  display.display();
  va_end(args);

  Serial.println(logMessage);
}
```

Now I will use the function everywhere where I print, which will print both to the screen and to the Serial. For example:

```c
  int getSensorReading() {
  int sensorReading = analogRead(SensorPin);
  logMessage("Sensor: %d \n", sensorReading);
  return sensorReading;
}
```

This is how it looks after I uploaded the sketch:

## Brainstorming a box / container

Now that I added the display, the initial idea I had for the form factor of the device has changed:

1. The enclosure needs to be water resistant (so I can put in my garden)
2. The internals should be easily accessible (to charge the battery and update the sketch if needed)
3. The sensor should be outside, so it can be plugged in the soil
4. The display should be visible, but inside the weather resistant container

With the new requirement I would have to make sure that a part of the box is transparent so that the display readings can be observed from outside.

The plan I have is to form the device based on a gardening tool which name I don't really know, but I'll call **seed hole puncher** ... you guessed it it's used to punch holes in the ground ... where seeds grow. This is how it looks like

<p
  align="center"
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'row',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  }}

  <Image
    alt="seed hole puncher image"
    src="/static/images/seed-hole-puncher.jpeg"
    width={512}
    height={256}
  />
</p>

Now imagine that the pointy peak it has is the soil moisture sensor and everything else is fitted inside of the handle. Also the handle is just straight, like a go pro grip with a transparent part on the top.
I have the vision but I'm definately not sure how I would create this out of thin air.

I don't have access to 3D printer or anything of this sort so I'll have to use things I find at home or at the nearest
hardware store. I went shopping and I found a cheap snow cleaning brush for cars. It was made out of thin plastic that I can cut and manipulate on my own. I also grabbed a few sterile containers that I can you as the top of the ... thing.

After a bit of R&D I ended up with something which represented my vision, or at least a prototype of it:

<p
  align="center"
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  }}
>
  {/* <h5>This is the **thing** in its closed weather resistant state</h5> */}

    height={256}
  />
</p>

<p
  align="center"
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  }}
>
  {/* <h5>This is the **thing** when the top cap is opened</h5> */}

  <Image
    alt="full prototype opened"
    src="/static/images/full-prototype-open.jpg"
    width={512}
    height={256}
  />
</p>

<p
  align="center"
  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  }}
>
  {/* <h5>This is the **thing** from the top, where the display can be inspected</h5> */}

  <Image
    alt="full prototype opened"
    src="/static/images/full-prototype-top.jpg"
    width={512}
    height={256}
  />
</p>

It seems that this meets all of my requirements! Now, let's test this on a real plant the basil that we take care of in our kitchen.

  style={{
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column',

  {/* <h5>No plants were harmed during the testing</h5> */}

## Testing and battery considerations

As I mention above, the display would certainly affect the battery life. But how much damage it would do? I decided to make some measurements and to find out. I brought up my multimeter and I set it to measure amps. Then I connected
the positive wire of the battery to the red probe on the multimeter and the negative (black) probe to the + of the ESP board. This should give me a reading of the amps the device uses and sure it does - during start up
the whole thing uses about 150mA and peaks up to 200mA while connecting to WiFi and sending data. This lasts about 9 seconds, after this the device goes to deep - sleep. When this happens my multimeter shows no consumption at all,
perhaps it's not that good and can't measure consumption this low. From sources I found online [such as this one](https://bitbanksoftware.blogspot.com/2019/06/how-much-current-do-oled-displays-use.html) I estimated that the display would use around 8mA while the Wemos D1 mini v4 around
**84ÂµA** (source [here](https://salvatorelab.com/2023/01/wemos-d1-mini-deep-sleep-current-draw/)). This souce also mentions that it can peak up to the whopping ~450mA, which is a lot.

Using [this cool calculator](https://www.of-things.de/battery-life-calculator.php) calculator the estimated time with the display always on at the default brightness is 11 days with a single battery.

    src="/static/images/battery-life-calculator-res.png"
    width={512}
    height={256}
  />
</p>

If I run the calculator again, this time with the data without the display, the results are as expected entirely different.

## Conclusions

All of the above are just estimations so I decided to actually test how long would it last with the OLED on. The results were terrible - around 4 days and a half with a battery close to 100%.
The next thing that I'm yet about to do is disconnect the OLED and carry out the test again. I'll be posting an update to this topic once I find out how long would it last for real.
