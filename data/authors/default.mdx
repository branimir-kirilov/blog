I'm a 26 year old software engineer from Sofia, Bulgaria. I have more than six years of professional experience, I have established myself as a valuable asset in the industry. I'm mostly focused on frontend (ReactJs) but I also have experience with backend (Node/Express/Java).

My passion for coding began in high school, where I first discovered my aptitude for programming and participated in several coding competitions. Today, I'm proud to be a technical lead for a team, where I'm am responsible for spearheading projects and guiding my colleagues towards success.

When I'm not working, I enjoy tinkering with IoT technology, which allows me to explore new and exciting possibilities in the field.

Beyond my work in software engineering, I'm an avid enthusiast of downhill biking and motorcycles, which give me a sense of freedom and exhilaration that I can't find anywhere else. I'm also passionate about photography and videography, and enjoy capturing the beauty of the world around me through my lens.
